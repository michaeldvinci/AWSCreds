# AWSCreds

Trying out my first real venture into Swift with a little Menubar app to help facilitate switching between AWS Profiles. 

Shoutout to [KubeContext](https://github.com/turkenh/KubeContext) and turkenh, who was cool with me cannibalizing it.

Roadmap:
* Implement Config
* Implement un-sandboxed terminal calls [right now it just copies the 'export AWS\_PROFILE=...' command]
